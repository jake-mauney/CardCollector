# CardCollector
Personal Prject to keep track of MTG cards and the decks they are in. This is not a serious project

## WishList
1. Decklist Generator
2. Website to share
3. Auto Price tracking
4. Decklist checker (Ensure collection has the cards for a uploaded Decklist)
5. Artist search (Be able to type in an artist and see if I have any cards illustrated by them)

## Preqs
- Running MySQL locally
- dependent upon tkinter, mysql.connector, importcsv and probably others later on
- You setup your "Card" columns as [Name, SetCode, SetNum, Foil, Price] <--This could change
