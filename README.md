# CardCollector
Personal Prject to keep track of MTG cards and the decks they are in. This is not a serious project

## WishList
- Decklist Generator
- Website to share
- Auto Price tracking

## Preqs
- Running MySQL locally
- dependent upon tkinter, mysql.connector, importcsv and probably others later on
- You setup your "Card" columns as [Name, SetCode, SetNum, Foil, Price] <--This could change
